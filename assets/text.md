A to Z Road is a Company specializing in pavement delineation/striping. We will be certified as a DVBE( disabled veteran-owned business enterprise), DBE(disadvantaged business enterprise), Small business, and Minority Owned(Native American). Caltrans has a State mandated percentage requirement on advertised contracts, for utilization of these business certifications. 

 

Besides being a profitable work scope, there is significant demand for striping companies with set aside business certifications.  Additionally, California is just beginning a significant and rigorous overhaul of its highways/freeways (Prop 6 revenues) that will span over the next decade.  A significant part of this overhaul includes replacing all 4 inch wide existing stripes with 6 inch and 8 inch stripes to increase visibility/safety, as well as provide greater sensitivity to autonomous automobiles.  The striping replacement will take place whether or not new surfacing is placed on a particular alignment or not
